Hi,

I'm Quentin, a French developer living in Paris.

I work at [Sikana](https://www.sikana.tv?target=_blank), a NGO trying to create a collaborative platform to share knowledge.

I'm writing in English for technical stuff, and in French when I'm feeling lyrical.

Throw me an e-mail at `quentin.barbosa` at `protonmail.com` or download my [resume](https://github.com/qbarbosa/resume/raw/master/Quentin_Barbosa_CV_EN.pdf?target=_blank).
