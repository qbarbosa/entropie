Hi,

I'm Quentin, a French developer living in Paris.

I am interested in technology when it's used for good causes such as culture, research, or education. And I'm a music lover too.

I write in English for technical stuff, and in French when I feel lyrical.

Throw me an e-mail at `quentin.barbosa` at `protonmail.com` or download my [resume](https://github.com/qbarbosa/resume/raw/master/Quentin_Barbosa_CV_EN.pdf).
