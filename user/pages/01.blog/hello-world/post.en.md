The word "entropy" stands for the mesure of chaos in the universe. I thought that was a good name for a blog where I wanted to throw my ideas in disorder.

Here, you will find articles in English and in French : about tech, and about some of my thoughts I'd be wanting to write down.

In order to develop it, I have made really simple choices: the website runs on the framework [Grav](http://getgrav.org) (based on Symfony, which I know well)
with a template inspired of [Brutalism](https://www.uxbrutalism.com/).

And all of this was done while listening to [N'to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smIafjm7Ecs).

Have a good read!
